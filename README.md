# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project contains more than 2000 transactions, of which 2% were found to be fraudulent and 98% were found to be genuine.

**Methodology**

A variety of techniques were used to detect fraudulent activity, including statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and manual review of suspicious transactions. In particular, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithms were implemented to classify transactions as either fraudulent or genuine. The accuracy of these algorithms were measured as follows: Naive Bayes accuracy: 0.9928022190232084 and Logistic Regression accuracy: 0.9989993328885924. Additionally, historical data on past fraud cases were used to identify patterns and trends in fraudulent activity.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

sklearn

**Running the project**

Clone the repository to your local machine

Install the required packages using pip

Run the CreditCardFraudDetection.ipynb notebook


**Results**

The analysis was able to successfully identify fraudulent activity in the dataset, with a 2% fraud rate. The Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithms used in this analysis have demonstrated high accuracy in classifying transactions. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on a small sample size, and further investigations should be conducted to confirm these findings and to identify other potential cases of fraud.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The results show that the implemented algorithms have a high accuracy in classifying transactions. However, it is important to note that this project is based on a small sample size and the results should be considered with caution. Additional measures such as real-time monitoring, data analysis and machine learning techniques should be implemented to prevent future frauds.
